# Checklist: LLM Transform Requirements Quality Validation

**Purpose**: Validate the requirements quality for LLM transformation functionality to ensure clarity, completeness, and consistency. This checklist validates the **requirements themselves**, not the implementation.

**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: 001-draft-init-spec
**Focus**: LLM transformation requirements (FR-038 series), responsibility assignment, mandatory execution
**Depth**: Standard (20-30 items)
**Context**: User reported that `/speckit.doc-update` performs file copy without LLM transformation despite Session 2025-10-17 Decision 39 (LLM transform always enabled, `--no-llm-transform` removed)

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 - Are LLM transformation responsibilities clearly assigned to AI agent vs backend script? [Completeness, Gap, Spec §FR-038]
- [ ] CHK002 - Is the mandatory nature of LLM transformation explicitly stated in requirements? [Completeness, Spec §FR-038]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are requirements defined for what happens when LLM transformation is not executed? [Gap, Exception Flow]
- [ ] CHK004 - Are requirements defined for the command template workflow that executes LLM transformation? [Gap, Spec §.claude/commands/speckit.doc-update.md]
- [ ] CHK005 - Is the execution order clearly defined (LLM transform → backend script)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-038]
- [ ] CHK006 - Are requirements defined for verifying LLM transformation was executed before generating docs? [Gap, Quality Assurance]
- [ ] CHK007 - Are requirements defined for all LLM transformation modes (README-only, QUICKSTART-only, spec.md extraction, integration)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-038]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK008 - Is "LLM transformation is always enabled" defined with explicit execution requirements? [Clarity, Spec §Session 2025-10-17 Q1]
- [ ] CHK009 - Is the term "use LLM transformation" clarified as "execute transformation" vs "use transformed content if available"? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-038]
- [ ] CHK010 - Are the distinct roles of AI agent (transformation executor) and backend script (content consumer) clearly articulated? [Clarity, Architecture]
- [ ] CHK011 - Is "transformed_content_map" parameter's optional nature vs transformation's mandatory nature reconciled? [Conflict, Spec §FR-038f vs doc_update.py]
- [ ] CHK012 - Are content source selection rules (README/QUICKSTART/spec.md) defined as pre-transformation steps? [Clarity, Spec §FR-038]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK013 - Are LLM transformation requirements consistent between spec.md FR-038 and command template speckit.doc-update.md? [Consistency, Spec §FR-038 vs §.claude/commands]
- [ ] CHK014 - Is Session 2025-10-17 Decision 39 ("always enabled") consistent with conditional logic in data-model.md? [Conflict, Decision 39 vs data-model.md:71-76]
- [ ] CHK015 - Are requirements consistent about who performs transformation (AI agent in FR-038 vs unclear in FR-012)? [Conflict, Spec §FR-038 vs §FR-012]
- [ ] CHK016 - Is the removal of `--no-llm-transform` consistent with always-mandatory execution requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Session 2025-10-17 Q1]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK017 - Can "LLM transformation executed successfully" be objectively verified in requirements? [Measurability, Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK018 - Are measurable criteria defined for distinguishing transformed vs non-transformed content? [Measurability, Gap]
- [ ] CHK019 - Are success criteria defined for each transformation mode (inconsistency detection, section priority, extraction)? [Measurability, Spec §FR-038-integ-a/b]
- [ ] CHK020 - Can the requirement "transformation is always executed" be tested without checking implementation? [Measurability, Acceptance Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK021 - Are requirements defined for the primary scenario: successful LLM transformation execution? [Coverage, Spec §FR-038]
- [ ] CHK022 - Are requirements defined for alternative scenarios when README.md only, QUICKSTART.md only, or both exist? [Coverage, Spec §FR-038]
- [ ] CHK023 - Are requirements defined for exception scenario: LLM API failure during transformation? [Coverage, Spec §FR-038b]
- [ ] CHK024 - Are requirements defined for recovery scenario: retrying transformation after transient failure? [Gap, Recovery Flow]
- [ ] CHK025 - Are requirements defined for edge case: transformation executed but content appears unchanged? [Gap, Edge Case]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK026 - Are performance requirements defined for LLM transformation execution time? [NFR, Gap]
- [ ] CHK027 - Are reliability requirements defined for transformation success rate? [NFR, Gap]
- [ ] CHK028 - Are requirements defined for logging/auditing transformation execution? [NFR, Observability, Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK029 - Is the dependency on AI agent environment (Claude Code) for executing transformations documented? [Dependency, Spec §Architecture]
- [ ] CHK030 - Are requirements defined for backend script behavior when running outside AI agent environment? [Gap, Assumption]
- [ ] CHK031 - Is the assumption "transformed_content_map parameter is always provided" validated or made explicit? [Assumption, Gap]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK032 - Why does FR-038f say "use LLM transformation" but implementation only "uses transformed content if available"? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-038f]
- [ ] CHK033 - Does "Session 2025-10-17 Decision 39: always enabled" mean "always executed" or "always available"? [Ambiguity, Decision 39]
- [ ] CHK034 - Is there a conflict between "no-llm-transform removed" and "transformed_content parameter is optional"? [Conflict, Decision 39 vs doc_update.py signature]
- [ ] CHK035 - Are requirements missing for command template responsibility to execute transformation before calling backend? [Gap, Command Template Spec]

## Summary

**Total Items**: 35
**Categories**:
- Requirement Completeness: 7 items
- Requirement Clarity: 5 items
- Requirement Consistency: 4 items
- Acceptance Criteria Quality: 4 items
- Scenario Coverage: 5 items
- Non-Functional Requirements: 3 items
- Dependencies & Assumptions: 3 items
- Ambiguities & Conflicts: 4 items

**Key Issues Identified** (through requirements analysis):
1. **Execution vs Availability**: Spec says "always enabled" but doesn't mandate execution
2. **Responsibility Gap**: Unclear which component (AI agent or backend) must execute transformation
3. **Command Template Missing**: No requirements for LLM transformation workflow in command template
4. **Optional Parameter Conflict**: `transformed_content` is optional but transformation should be mandatory

**Next Steps**:
- Review each checklist item to identify requirements gaps
- Clarify "always enabled" to mean "always executed"
- Define AI agent responsibilities in command template requirements
- Add validation requirements to ensure transformation was executed
