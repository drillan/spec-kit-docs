# Feature Specification: English Test Spec

## Overview

This is a test sample for English headings.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ must be available
- spec-kit project must be initialized (`.specify/` directory exists)
- Valid spec.md file for testing

## User Stories

### User Story 1: Document Initialization (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Purpose**: Enable spec-kit users to initialize a documentation project with a single command, allowing them to establish an appropriate documentation foundation for their project without manually creating directories or editing configuration files.

**Rationale for this priority**: This is a prerequisite for document generation.

**Independent Test**: User runs `/speckit.doc-init --type sphinx` in a spec-kit project.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given**: Valid spec-kit project, **When**: User runs `/speckit.doc-init --type sphinx`, **Then**: System interactively asks for project name, author, version, and creates Sphinx project in `docs/`

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope (Phase 1 - MVP)

- spec.md minimal extraction implementation
- User story purposes, prerequisites, and scope boundaries extraction
- Token limit validation (max 10,000 tokens)

### Out of Scope (Phase 1 - MVP)

- Clarifications section extraction
- Success Criteria section extraction
- Implementation plan (plan.md) extraction
- Task list (tasks.md) extraction

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Minimal information is extracted from spec.md
- [ ] Clarifications section is excluded
- [ ] Token count is within 10,000 tokens
